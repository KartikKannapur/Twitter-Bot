Twitter-Bot
===========

Twitter bots are computer programs that watch every public tweet on Twitter. When a bot finds a tweet with a certain keyword or addressed to a Twitter account, it either sends a pre-written response, re-tweets or it follows the Twitter account.
In my case I have created a Bot @CodeTerminal
